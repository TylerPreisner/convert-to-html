# convert-to-html
this is a python script that converts a txt file that is formated similar to markdown, although a lot different, into a html file for ease of creating blog posts for my site at tylerpreisner.github.io.
The format is:

head;the title of the post;the description;

title;the title of the section;

paragraph;the content of the section;

code;the content of the code block,if you want multiple lines seperate them by a comma as so;
